                    <p className='pb-8'>Hi I'm Sidney. I've been coding since 2021.</p>

                    <p className='pb-8'>I try to keep things updated around here as much as possible, but I'm always learning or building something new. For now, let's have story time.</p>
                    
                    <p className='pb-8'>Curious how I got here? Here's how I started making websites.</p>

                    <p className='pb-8'>I taught myself to code during the pandemic when I was furloughed from my job as a flight attendant. I started learning the same way many do: Khan Academy, Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, and The Odin Project. I bounced between them in about this order, depending on where I was at in my learning. Frontend was my favorite, perhaps the immediate gratification is what drew me.</p>
                    
                    <p className='pb-8'>After about 6 months of full-time self-study, I decided I was ready to start applying for jobs. It took me another month to polish my projects and create my first portfolio (Gatsby). In a couple of months with some luck, I got an interview and landed my first tech job as a Jr Front-end Developer.</p>
                                        
                    <p className='pb-8'>Before I started coding, I was unsure if I would like it. Many success stories largely brush over the hard parts, but I want to call out the fact that those were very difficult times. I'm proud of my courage, more than anything else. I'll be cheering for anyone who finds the courage to endure uncertainty in order to grow.</p>

                    <p className='pb-8'>I'm happy to report that I like what I do. Coding makes me feel engaged, adequately challenged day to day, and I love seeing the results of my work.</p>
